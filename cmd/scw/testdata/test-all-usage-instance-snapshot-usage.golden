Snapshots contain the data of a specified volume at a particular point in time.
The data can include the Instance's operating system,
configuration information and/or files stored on the volume.

A snapshot can be done from a specified volume, e.g. you
have one Instance with a volume containing the OS and another one
containing the application data, and you want to use different
snapshot strategies on both volumes.

Volumes can be created from snapshots of their own type.
