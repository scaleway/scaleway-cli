This method allows to reboot a specific node. This node will frist be cordoned, meaning that scheduling will be disabled. Then the existing pods on the node will be drained and reschedule onto another schedulable node. Note that when there is not enough space to reschedule all the pods (in a one node cluster for instance), you may experience some disruption of your applications.
