A Read Replica is a live copy of a Database Instance that behaves like an Instance, but that only allows read-only connections.
The replica mirrors the data of the primary Database node and any changes made are replicated to the replica asynchronously. Read Replicas allow you to scale your Database Instance for read-heavy database workloads. They can also be used for business intelligence workloads.

A Read Replica can have at most one direct access and one Private Network endpoint. `Loadbalancer` endpoints are not available on Read Replicas even if this resource is displayed in the Read Replica response example.

If you want to remove a Read Replica endpoint, you can use [delete a Database Instance endpoint](#path-endpoints-delete-a-database-instance-endpoint) API call.

Instance Access Control Lists (ACL) also apply to Read Replica direct access endpoints.

**Limitations:**
There might be replication lags between the primary node and its Read Replica nodes. You can try to reduce this lag with some good practices:
* All your tables should have a primary key
* Don't run large transactions that modify, delete or insert lots of rows. Try to split it into several small transactions.
