Update a DHCP configuration object, identified by its DHCP ID.

USAGE:
  scw vpc-gw dhcp update <dhcp-id ...> [arg=value ...]

ARGS:
  dhcp-id                          DHCP configuration to update
  [subnet]                         Subnet for the DHCP server
  [address]                        IP address of the DHCP server. This will be the Public Gateway's address in the Private Network. It must be part of config's subnet
  [pool-low]                       Low IP (inclusive) of the dynamic address pool. Must be in the config's subnet
  [pool-high]                      High IP (inclusive) of the dynamic address pool. Must be in the config's subnet
  [enable-dynamic]                 Defines whether to enable dynamic pooling of IPs. When false, only pre-existing DHCP reservations will be handed out. Defaults to true
  [valid-lifetime]                 How long DHCP entries will be valid for
  [renew-timer]                    After how long a renew will be attempted. Must be 30s lower than `rebind_timer`
  [rebind-timer]                   After how long a DHCP client will query for a new lease if previous renews fail. Must be 30s lower than `valid_lifetime`
  [push-default-route]             Defines whether the gateway should push a default route to DHCP clients, or only hand out IPs
  [push-dns-server]                Defines whether the gateway should push custom DNS servers to clients. This allows for instance hostname -> IP resolution
  [dns-servers-override.{index}]   Array of DNS server IP addresses used to override the DNS server list pushed to DHCP clients, instead of the gateway itself
  [dns-search.{index}]             Array of search paths in addition to the pushed DNS configuration
  [dns-local-name]                 TLD given to hostnames in the Private Networks. If an instance with hostname `foo` gets a lease, and this is set to `bar`, `foo.bar` will resolve. Allowed characters are `a-z0-9-.`
  [zone=fr-par-1]                  Zone to target. If none is passed will use default zone from the config (fr-par-1 | fr-par-2 | nl-ams-1 | nl-ams-2 | nl-ams-3 | pl-waw-1 | pl-waw-2 | pl-waw-3)
