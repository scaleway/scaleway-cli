User data is a key/value store you can use to provide your instance with introspective data.

As an example of use, Scaleway images contain the `scw-generate-ssh-keys` script, which generates the SSH server’s host keys, then stores their fingerprints as user data under the `ssh-host-fingerprints` key.
This way, before connecting to the instance using SSH, one can query the fingerprints to ensure that the remote host is the expected one, thus avoiding any man-in-the-middle attack.

There are two ways of accessing user data:
 - **From within a running Instance**, by requesting the Metadata API at http://169.254.42.42/user_data (or http://[fd00:42::42]/user_data using IPv6).
   The `scaleway-ecosystem` package, installed by default on all OS images provided by Scaleway, ships with the `scw-userdata` helper command that allows you to easily query the user data from the instance.
   For security reasons, viewing and editing user data is only allowed to queries originating from a port below 1024 (by default, only the super-user can bind to ports below 1024).
   To specify the source port with cURL, use the `--local-port` option (e.g. `curl --local-port 1-1023 http://169.254.42.42/user_data`).
 - **From the Instance API** by using the methods described below.
