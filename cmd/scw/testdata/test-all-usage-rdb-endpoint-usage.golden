A point of connection to a Database Instance. The endpoint is associated with an IPv4 address and a port. It contains the information about whether the endpoint is read-write or not. The endpoints always point to the main node of a Database Instance.

All endpoints have TLS enabled. You can use TLS to make your data and your passwords unreadable in transit to anyone but you.

For added security, you can set up ACL rules to restrict access to your endpoint to a set of trusted hosts or networks of your choice.

Load Balancers are used to forward traffic to the right node based on the node state (active/hot standby). The Load Balancers' configuration is set to cut off inactive connections if no TCP traffic is sent within a 6-hour timeframe. We recommend using connection pooling on the application side to renew database connections regularly.
