Snapshots contain the data of a specific volume at a particular point in time.
The data can include the instance's operating system,
configuration information or files stored on the volume.

A snapshot can be done from a specific volume (for example you
have a server with a volume containing the OS and another one
containing the application data, and you want to use different
snapshot strategies on both volumes).

Snapshots only work on `l_ssd` volume type at the moment. `b_ssd`
snapshots will be available starting 2020.
