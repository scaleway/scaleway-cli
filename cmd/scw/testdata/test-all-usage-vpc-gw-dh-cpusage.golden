These objects define a DHCP configuration, i.e. how IP addresses should be assigned to devices on a Private Network attached to a Public Gateway. Definable parameters include the subnet for the DHCP server, the validity  period for DHCP entries, whether to use dynamic pooling, and more. A DHCP configuration object has a DHCP ID, which can then be used as part of a  call to create or update a Gateway Network. This lets you attach an existing DHCP configuration to a Public Gateway attached to a Private Network. Similarly, you can use a DHCP ID as a query parameter to list Gateway Networks which use this DHCP configuration object.
