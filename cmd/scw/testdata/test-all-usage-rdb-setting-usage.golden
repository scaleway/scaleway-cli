Advanced Database Instance settings allow you to tune the behavior of your database engines to better fit your needs.

Available settings depend on the database engine and its version. Note that some settings can only be defined upon database engine initialization. These are called init settings. You can find a full list of the settings available in the response body of the [list available database engines](#path-databases-list-databases-in-a-database-instance) endpoint.

Each advanced setting entry has a default value that users can override. The deletion of a setting entry will restore the setting to default value. Some of the defaults values can be different from the engine's defaults, as we optimize them to the Scaleway platform.
