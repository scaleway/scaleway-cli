Delete a specific Node. The node will first be drained and pods will be rescheduled onto another node. Note that when there is not enough space to reschedule all the pods (such as in a one-node cluster, or with specific constraints), disruption of your applications may occur.

USAGE:
  scw k8s node delete <node-id ...> [arg=value ...]

EXAMPLES:
  Delete a node
    scw k8s node delete 11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111

  Delete a node without evicting workloads
    scw k8s node delete 11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111 skip-drain=true

  Replace a node by a new one
