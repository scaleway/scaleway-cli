A pool is a set of identical nodes
A pool has a name, a size (its desired number of nodes), node number limits (min, max), and a Scaleway Instance type. Changing those limits increases/decreases the size of a pool. As a result and depending on its load, the pool will grow or shrink within those limits when autoscaling is enabled.
