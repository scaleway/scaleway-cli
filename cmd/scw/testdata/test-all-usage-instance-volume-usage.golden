A volume is where you store your data inside your Instance. It
appears as a block device on Linux that you can use to create
a filesystem and mount it.

The Instance API only supports local (`l_ssd`) and `scratch` volume types.
Block storage volumes can also be attached to Instances, these volumes are
managed by the SBS API (https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/block/).

Minimum and maximum volume sizes for each volume types can be queried
from the zone `/products/volumes` API endpoint. _I.e_ for:
  - `fr-par-1`  use https://api.scaleway.com/instance/v1/zones/fr-par-1/products/volumes
  - `nl-ams-1`  use https://api.scaleway.com/instance/v1/zones/nl-ams-1/products/volumes

Each type of volume is also subject to a global quota for the sum of all the
volumes. This quota depends of the level of support and may be
changed on demand.

When using multiple block devices, it's advised to mount them by
using their UUID instead of their device name. A device name is
subject to change depending on the volumes order. Block devices
UUIDs can be found in `/dev/disk/by-id/`.
