Server types are denomination of the different instances we provide.
Scaleway offers **Virtual Cloud** and **dedicated GPU** instances.

**Virtual Cloud Instances**

Virtual cloud instances are offering the best performance/price ratio for most workloads. Different CPU architectures are proposed: The **Development** and **General Purpose** ranges are based on AMD EPYC CPUs. The **ARM64** range is based on Cavium Thunder X ARM CPUs.

* The **Development** instances range provides stable and consistent performance for development needs.
  Spin up a development or test environment within seconds.
  Refer to the [Development Instance offer details](https://www.scaleway.com/en/development-instances/) for more information.

* The **General Purpose** instances range is the solution for demanding workloads.
  Powerful AMD EPYC CPUs back those instances and offer up to 48 Cores, 256GB of RAM and 600GB of replicated local NVMe SSD storage.
  Refer to the [General Purpose offer details](https://www.scaleway.com/en/general-purpose-instances/) for more information.

* The **ARM** instances range is based on Cavium ThunderX SoCs and provides up to 64 Cores ARM 64bit, 128GB of RAM and 1TB SSD storage.
  Refer to the [ARM offer details](https://www.scaleway.com/en/arm-instances) for more information.

**Dedicated GPU Instances**

GPU instances are very powerful compute instances, providing lots of RAM, vCPU, and storage.

They are equipped with Nvidia Tesla P100 GPUs, which are designed for handling rapidly, a massive amount of data.
They are useful for heavy data processing, artificial intelligence and machine learning, video encoding, rendering, and so on.
The GPU is dedicated to each instance and directly exposed through PCI-e.
