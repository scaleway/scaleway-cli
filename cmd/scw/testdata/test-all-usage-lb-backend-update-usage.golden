Update a backend of a given Load Balancer, specified by its backend ID. Note that the request type is PUT and not PATCH. You must set all parameters.

USAGE:
  scw lb backend update <backend-id ...> [arg=value ...]

ARGS:
  backend-id                      Backend ID
  name                            Backend name
  forward-protocol                Protocol to be used by the backend when forwarding traffic to backend servers (tcp | http)
  forward-port                    Port to be used by the backend when forwarding traffic to backend servers
  forward-port-algorithm          Load balancing algorithm to be used when determining which backend server to forward new traffic to (roundrobin | leastconn | first)
  sticky-sessions                 Defines whether to activate sticky sessions (binding a particular session to a particular backend server) and the method to use if so. None disables sticky sessions. Cookie-based uses an HTTP cookie to stick a session to a backend server. Table-based uses the source (client) IP address to stick a session to a backend server (none | cookie | table)
  [sticky-sessions-cookie-name]   Cookie name for cookie-based sticky sessions
  [timeout-server=5m]             Maximum allowed time for a backend server to process a request
  [timeout-connect=5s]            Maximum allowed time for establishing a connection to a backend server
  [timeout-tunnel=15m]            Maximum allowed tunnel inactivity time after Websocket is established (takes precedence over client and server timeout)
  [on-marked-down-action]         Action to take when a backend server is marked as down (on_marked_down_action_none | shutdown_sessions)
  [proxy-protocol]                Protocol to use between the Load Balancer and backend servers. Allows the backend servers to be informed of the client's real IP address. The PROXY protocol must be supported by the backend servers' software (proxy_protocol_unknown | proxy_protocol_none | proxy_protocol_v1 | proxy_protocol_v2 | proxy_protocol_v2_ssl | proxy_protocol_v2_ssl_cn)
  [failover-host]                 Scaleway Object Storage bucket website to be served as failover if all backend servers are down, e.g. failover-website.s3-website.fr-par.scw.cloud
  [ssl-bridging]                  Defines whether to enable SSL bridging between the Load Balancer and backend servers
  [ignore-ssl-server-verify]      Defines whether the server certificate verification should be ignored
  [redispatch-attempt-count]      Whether to use another backend server on each attempt
  [max-retries]                   Number of retries when a backend server connection failed
  [max-connections]               Maximum number of connections allowed per backend server
  [timeout-queue]                 Maximum time for a request to be left pending in queue when `max_connections` is reached
  [zone=fr-par-1]                 Zone to target. If none is passed will use default zone from the config (fr-par-1 | fr-par-2 | nl-ams-1 | nl-ams-2 | nl-ams-3 | pl-waw-1 | pl-waw-2 | pl-waw-3)

DEPRECATED ARGS:
  [send-proxy-v2]   Deprecated in favor of proxy_protocol field

FLAGS:
  -h, --help   help for update

GLOBAL FLAGS:
  -c, --config string    The path to the config file
  -D, --debug            Enable debug mode
  -o, --output string    Output format: json or human, see 'scw help output' for more info (default "human")
  -p, --profile string   The config profile to use
