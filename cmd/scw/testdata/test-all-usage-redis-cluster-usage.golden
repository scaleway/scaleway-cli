A Redis™ Database Instance, also known as a Redis™ cluster, consists of either one standalone node or a cluster composed of three to six nodes. The cluster uses partitioning to split the keyspace. Each partition is replicated and can be reassigned or elected as the primary when necessary. Standalone mode creates a standalone database provisioned on a single node.
