Two different types of volume (`volume_type`) are provided: `l_ssd` is a local block storage which means your system is stored locally on your node's hypervisor. `b_ssd` is a remote block storage which means your system is stored on a centralized and resilient cluster (default_volume_type | l_ssd | b_ssd)
  [pools.{index}.root-volume-size]                       System volume disk size
  [autoscaler-config.scale-down-disabled]                Disable the cluster autoscaler
  [autoscaler-config.scale-down-delay-after-add]         How long after scale up that scale down evaluation resumes
  [autoscaler-config.estimator]                          Type of resource estimator to be used in scale up (unknown_estimator | binpacking)

This is typically the provider's discovery URL without a path, for example "https://accounts.google.com" or "https://login.salesforce.com"
  [open-id-connect-config.client-id]                     A client ID that all tokens must be issued for
  [open-id-connect-config.username-claim]                JWT claim to use as the user name. The default is `sub`, which is expected to be the end user's unique identifier. Admins can choose other claims, such as `email` or `name`, depending on their provider. However, claims other than `email` will be prefixed with the issuer URL to prevent name collision
  [open-id-connect-config.username-prefix]               Prefix prepended to username claims to prevent name collision (such as `system:` users). For example, the value `oidc:` will create usernames like `oidc:jane.doe`. If this flag is not provided and `username_claim` is a value other than `email`, the prefix defaults to `( Issuer URL )#` where `( Issuer URL )` is the value of `issuer_url`. The value `-` can be used to disable all prefixing

  [open-id-connect-config.groups-prefix]                 Prefix prepended to group claims to prevent name collision (such as `system:` groups). For example, the value `oidc:` will create group names like `oidc:engineering` and `oidc:infra`
  [open-id-connect-config.required-claim.{index}]        Multiple key=value pairs describing a required claim in the ID token. If set, the claims are verified to be present in the ID token with a matching value

  [private-network-id]                                   Private network ID for internal cluster communication (cannot be changed later). For Kapsule clusters, if none is provided, a private network will be created
  [organization-id]                                      Organization ID to use. If none is passed the default organization ID will be used
  [region=fr-par]                                        Region to target. If none is passed will use default region from the config (fr-par | nl-ams | pl-waw)
