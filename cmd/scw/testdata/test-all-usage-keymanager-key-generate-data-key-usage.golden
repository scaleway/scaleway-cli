Create a new data encryption key for cryptographic operations outside of Key Manager. The data encryption key is encrypted and must be decrypted using the key you have created in Key Manager.

The data encryption key is returned in plaintext and ciphertext but it should only be stored in its encrypted form (ciphertext). Key Manager does not store your data encryption key. To retrieve your key's plaintext, use the `Decrypt` method with your key's ID and ciphertext.

USAGE:
  scw keymanager key generate-data-key <key-id ...> [arg=value ...]

ARGS:
  key-id                    ID of the key
  [algorithm=aes_256_gcm]   Algorithm with which the data encryption key will be used to encrypt and decrypt arbitrary payloads (unknown_symmetric_encryption | aes_256_gcm)
  [without-plaintext]       (Optional) Defines whether to return the data encryption key's plaintext in the response object
  [region=fr-par]           Region to target. If none is passed will use default region from the config (fr-par | nl-ams | pl-waw)

FLAGS:
  -h, --help   help for generate-data-key

GLOBAL FLAGS:
  -c, --config string    The path to the config file
  -D, --debug            Enable debug mode
  -o, --output string    Output format: json or human, see 'scw help output' for more info (default "human")
  -p, --profile string   The config profile to use
