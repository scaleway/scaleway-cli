Create a new Load Balancer. Note that the Load Balancer will be created without frontends or backends; these must be created separately via the dedicated endpoints.

USAGE:
  scw lb lb create [arg=value ...]

ARGS:
  [project-id]                   Project ID to use. If none is passed the default project ID will be used
  name=<generated>               Name for the Load Balancer
  [description]                  Description for the Load Balancer
  [assign-flexible-ip=true]      Defines whether to automatically assign a flexible public IP to the Load Balancer. Default value is `true` (assign).
  [assign-flexible-ipv6=false]   Defines whether to automatically assign a flexible public IPv6 to the Load Balancer. Default value is `false` (do not assign).
  [ip-ids.{index}]               List of IP IDs to attach to the Load Balancer
  [tags.{index}]                 List of tags for the Load Balancer
  [type=LB-S]                    Load Balancer commercial offer type. Use the Load Balancer types endpoint to retrieve a list of available offer types (LB-S | LB-GP-M | LB-GP-L)
  [ssl-compatibility-level]      Determines the minimal SSL version which needs to be supported on the client side, in an SSL/TLS offloading context. Intermediate is suitable for general-purpose servers with a variety of clients, recommended for almost all systems. Modern is suitable for services with clients that support TLS 1.3 and do not need backward compatibility. Old is compatible with a small number of very old clients and should be used only as a last resort (ssl_compatibility_level_unknown | ssl_compatibility_level_intermediate | ssl_compatibility_level_modern | ssl_compatibility_level_old)
  [organization-id]              Organization ID to use. If none is passed the default organization ID will be used
  [zone=fr-par-1]                Zone to target. If none is passed will use default zone from the config (fr-par-1 | fr-par-2 | nl-ams-1 | nl-ams-2 | nl-ams-3 | pl-waw-1 | pl-waw-2 | pl-waw-3)

DEPRECATED ARGS:
  [ip-id]   ID of an existing flexible IP address to attach to the Load Balancer

FLAGS:
  -h, --help   help for create
  -w, --wait   wait until the lb is ready

GLOBAL FLAGS:
  -c, --config string    The path to the config file
  -D, --debug            Enable debug mode
  -o, --output string    Output format: json or human, see 'scw help output' for more info (default "human")
  -p, --profile string   The config profile to use
  -y, --yes              Automatically confirm all interactive prompts
