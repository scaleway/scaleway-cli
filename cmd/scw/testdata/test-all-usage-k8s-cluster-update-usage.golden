Update information on a specific Kubernetes cluster. You can update details such as its name, description, tags and configuration. To upgrade a cluster, you will need to use the dedicated endpoint.

USAGE:
  scw k8s cluster update <cluster-id ...> [arg=value ...]

EXAMPLES:
  Add InPlacePodVerticalScaling and SidecarContainers as feature gates on a cluster
    scw k8s cluster update 11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111 feature-gates.0=InPlacePodVerticalScaling feature-gates.1=SidecarContainers

  Remove all custom feature gates on a cluster
    scw k8s cluster update 11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111 feature-gates=none

ARGS:
  cluster-id                                             ID of the cluster to update
  [name]                                                 New external name for the cluster
  [description]                                          New description for the cluster
  [tags.{index}]                                         New tags associated with the cluster
  [autoscaler-config.scale-down-disabled]                Forbid cluster autoscaler to scale down the cluster, defaults to false
  [autoscaler-config.scale-down-delay-after-add]         How long after scale up the scale down evaluation resumes
  [autoscaler-config.estimator]                          Type of resource estimator to be used in scale up (unknown_estimator | binpacking)
  [autoscaler-config.expander]                           Kubernetes autoscaler strategy to fit pods into nodes, see https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/FAQ.md#what-are-expanders for details (unknown_expander | random | most_pods | least_waste | priority | price)
  [autoscaler-config.ignore-daemonsets-utilization]      Ignore DaemonSet pods when calculating resource utilization for scaling down, defaults to false
  [autoscaler-config.balance-similar-node-groups]        Detect similar node groups and balance the number of nodes between them, defaults to false
  [autoscaler-config.expendable-pods-priority-cutoff]    Pods with priority below cutoff will be expendable. They can be killed without any consideration during scale down and they won't cause scale up. Pods with null priority (PodPriority disabled) are non expendable
  [autoscaler-config.scale-down-unneeded-time]           How long a node should be unneeded before it is eligible for scale down, defaults to 10 minutes
  [autoscaler-config.scale-down-utilization-threshold]   Node utilization level, defined as a sum of requested resources divided by allocatable capacity, below which a node can be considered for scale down
  [autoscaler-config.max-graceful-termination-sec]       Maximum number of seconds the cluster autoscaler waits for pod termination when trying to scale down a node, defaults to 600 (10 minutes)
  [auto-upgrade.enable]                                  Defines whether auto upgrade is enabled for the cluster
  [auto-upgrade.maintenance-window.start-hour]           Start time of the two-hour maintenance window
  [auto-upgrade.maintenance-window.day]                  Day of the week for the maintenance window (any | monday | tuesday | wednesday | thursday | friday | saturday | sunday)
  [feature-gates.{index}]                                List of feature gates to enable
  [admission-plugins.{index}]                            List of admission plugins to enable
  [open-id-connect-config.issuer-url]                    URL of the provider which allows the API server to discover public signing keys. Only URLs using the `https://` scheme are accepted. This is typically the provider's discovery URL without a path, for example "https://accounts.google.com" or "https://login.salesforce.com"
  [open-id-connect-config.client-id]                     A client ID that all tokens must be issued for
  [open-id-connect-config.username-claim]                JWT claim to use as the user name. The default is `sub`, which is expected to be the end user's unique identifier. Admins can choose other claims, such as `email` or `name`, depending on their provider. However, claims other than `email` will be prefixed with the issuer URL to prevent name collision
  [open-id-connect-config.username-prefix]               Prefix prepended to username claims to prevent name collision (such as `system:` users). For example, the value `oidc:` will create usernames like `oidc:jane.doe`. If this flag is not provided and `username_claim` is a value other than `email`, the prefix defaults to `( Issuer URL )#` where `( Issuer URL )` is the value of `issuer_url`. The value `-` can be used to disable all prefixing
  [open-id-connect-config.groups-claim.{index}]          JWT claim to use as the user's group
  [open-id-connect-config.groups-prefix]                 Prefix prepended to group claims to prevent name collision (such as `system:` groups). For example, the value `oidc:` will create group names like `oidc:engineering` and `oidc:infra`
  [open-id-connect-config.required-claim.{index}]        Multiple key=value pairs describing a required claim in the ID token. If set, the claims are verified to be present in the ID token with a matching value
  [apiserver-cert-sans.{index}]                          Additional Subject Alternative Names for the Kubernetes API server certificate
  [region=fr-par]                                        Region to target. If none is passed will use default region from the config (fr-par | nl-ams | pl-waw)

FLAGS:
  -h, --help                help for update
      --list-sub-commands   List all subcommands
  -w, --wait                wait until the cluster is ready

GLOBAL FLAGS:
  -c, --config string    The path to the config file
  -D, --debug            Enable debug mode
  -o, --output string    Output format: json or human, see 'scw help output' for more info (default "human")
  -p, --profile string   The config profile to use
