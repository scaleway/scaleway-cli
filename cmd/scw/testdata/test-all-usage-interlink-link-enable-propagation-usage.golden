Enable all allowed prefixes (defined in a routing policy) to be announced in the BGP session. This allows traffic to flow between the attached VPC and the on-premises infrastructure along the announced routes. Note that by default, even when route propagation is enabled, all routes are blocked. It is essential to attach a routing policy to define the ranges of routes to announce.
