Given a volume or snapshot, returns the migration plan but does not perform the actual migration. To perform the migration, you have to call the [Migrate a volume and/or snapshots to SBS](#path-volumes-migrate-a-volume-andor-snapshots-to-sbs-scaleway-block-storage) endpoint afterward.
The endpoint returns the resources that should be migrated together:
- the volume and any snapshots created from the volume, if the call was made to plan a volume migration.
- the base volume of the snapshot (if the volume is not deleted) and its related snapshots, if the call was made to plan a snapshot migration.
The endpoint also returns the validation_key, which must be provided to the [Migrate a volume and/or snapshots to SBS](#path-volumes-migrate-a-volume-andor-snapshots-to-sbs-scaleway-block-storage) endpoint to confirm that all resources listed in the plan should be migrated.
