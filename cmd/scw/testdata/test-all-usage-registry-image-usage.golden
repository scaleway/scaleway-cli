An image represents a container image. A container image is a file that includes all the requirements and instructions of a complete and executable version of an application. When running, it becomes one or multiple instances of that application.

The visibility of an image can be public - when anyone can pull it, private - when only users within your organization can pull it, or inherited from the namespace visibility - which is the default. The visibility of your image can be changed using the [update image endpoit](#path-images-update-an-image).
