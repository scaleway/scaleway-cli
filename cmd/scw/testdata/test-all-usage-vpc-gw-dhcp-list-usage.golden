List DHCP configurations, optionally filtering by Organization, Project, Public Gateway IP address or more. The response is an array of DHCP configuration objects, each identified by a DHCP ID and containing configuration settings for the assignment of IP addresses to devices on a Private Network attached to a Public Gateway. Note that the response does not contain the IDs of any Private Network / Public Gateway the configuration is attached to. Use the `List Public Gateway connections to Private Networks` method for that purpose, filtering on DHCP ID.
