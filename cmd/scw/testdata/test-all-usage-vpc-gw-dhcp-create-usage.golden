Create a new DHCP configuration object, containing settings for the assignment of IP addresses to devices on a Private Network attached to a Public Gateway. The response object includes the ID of the DHCP configuration object. You can use this ID as part of a call to `Create a Public Gateway connection to a Private Network` or `Update a Public Gateway connection to a Private Network` to directly apply this DHCP configuration.

USAGE:
  scw vpc-gw dhcp create [arg=value ...]

ARGS:
  [project-id]                     Project ID to use. If none is passed the default project ID will be used
  subnet                           Subnet for the DHCP server
  [address]                        IP address of the DHCP server. This will be the gateway's address in the Private Network. Defaults to the first address of the subnet
  [pool-low]                       Low IP (inclusive) of the dynamic address pool. Must be in the config's subnet. Defaults to the second address of the subnet
  [pool-high]                      High IP (inclusive) of the dynamic address pool. Must be in the config's subnet. Defaults to the last address of the subnet
  [enable-dynamic]                 Defines whether to enable dynamic pooling of IPs. When false, only pre-existing DHCP reservations will be handed out. Defaults to true
  [valid-lifetime]                 How long DHCP entries will be valid for. Defaults to 1h (3600s)
  [renew-timer]                    After how long a renew will be attempted. Must be 30s lower than `rebind_timer`. Defaults to 50m (3000s)
  [rebind-timer]                   After how long a DHCP client will query for a new lease if previous renews fail. Must be 30s lower than `valid_lifetime`. Defaults to 51m (3060s)
  [push-default-route]             Defines whether the gateway should push a default route to DHCP clients or only hand out IPs. Defaults to true
  [push-dns-server]                Defines whether the gateway should push custom DNS servers to clients. This allows for Instance hostname -> IP resolution. Defaults to true
  [dns-servers-override.{index}]   Array of DNS server IP addresses used to override the DNS server list pushed to DHCP clients, instead of the gateway itself
  [dns-search.{index}]             Array of search paths in addition to the pushed DNS configuration
  [dns-local-name]                 TLD given to hostnames in the Private Network. Allowed characters are `a-z0-9-.`. Defaults to the slugified Private Network name if created along a GatewayNetwork, or else to `priv`
  [zone=fr-par-1]                  Zone to target. If none is passed will use default zone from the config (fr-par-1 | fr-par-2 | nl-ams-1 | nl-ams-2 | nl-ams-3 | pl-waw-1 | pl-waw-2 | pl-waw-3)

FLAGS:
