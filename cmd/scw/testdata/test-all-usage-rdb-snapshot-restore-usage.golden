Restore a snapshot. When you restore a snapshot, a new Instance is created and billed to your account. Note that is possible to select a larger node type for your new Database Instance. However, the Block volume size will be the same as the size of the restored snapshot. All Instance settings will be restored if you chose a node type with the same or more memory size than the initial Instance. Settings will be reset to the default if your node type has less memory.
