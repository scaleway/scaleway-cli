Remove a user or an application from a group. You can specify a `user_id` and and `application_id` in the body of your request. Note that you can only remove one of each per request. Removing a user from a group means that any permissions given to them via the group (i.e. from an attached policy) will no longer apply. Be sure you want to remove these permissions from the user before proceeding.
