Advanced settings allow you to tune the behavior of your Redis™ database engine to better fit your needs. Available settings depend on the version of the Redis™ engine. Note that some settings can only be defined upon the Redis™ engine initialization. These are called init settings. You can find a full list of the settings available in the response body of the [list available Redis™ versions](#path-redistm-engine-versions-list-available-redistm-versions) endpoint.

Each advanced setting entry has a default value that users can override. The deletion of a setting entry will restore the setting to default value. Some of the defaults values can be different from the engine's defaults, as we optimize them to the Scaleway platform.
