## Access Control List (ACL) management commands

Network Access Control Lists (ACLs) allow you to manage network inbound traffic by setting up ACL rules.

## Cluster management commands

A Redis™ Database Instance, also known as a Redis™ cluster, consists of either one standalone node or a cluster composed of three to six nodes. The cluster uses partitioning to split the keyspace. Each partition is replicated and can be reassigned or elected as the primary when necessary. Standalone mode creates a standalone database provisioned on a single node.


### Create a Redis™ Database Instance

## Settings management commands

Advanced settings allow you to tune the behavior of your Redis™ database engine to better fit your needs. Available settings depend on the version of the Redis™ engine.

You can find a full list of the settings available in the response body of the [list available Redis™ versions](#path-redistm-engine-versions-list-available-redistm-versions) endpoint.

Each advanced setting entry has a default value that users can override. The deletion of a setting entry will restore the setting to default value. Some of the defaults values can be different from the engine's defaults, as we optimize them to the Scaleway platform.
