## Connection commands

Connection commands.

Connection commands.

**Usage:**

```
scw interlink connection
```



## Link commands

Link commands.


### Attach a routing policy

Attach a routing policy to an existing link. As all routes across the link are blocked by default, you must attach a routing policy to set IP prefix filters for allowed routes, facilitating traffic flow.

**Usage:**

```
scw interlink link attach_policy <link-id ...> [arg=value ...]
```


**Args:**

| Name |   | Description |
|------|---|-------------|
| link-id | Required | ID of the link to attach a routing policy to |
| routing-policy-id | Required | ID of the routing policy to be attached |
| region | Default: `fr-par`<br />One of: `fr-par`, `nl-ams`, `pl-waw` | Region to target. If none is passed will use default region from the config |



### Attach a VPC

Attach a VPC to an existing link. This facilitates communication between the resources in your Scaleway VPC, and your on-premises infrastructure.

**Usage:**

```
scw interlink link attach_vpc <link-id ...> [arg=value ...]
```


**Args:**

| Name |   | Description |
|------|---|-------------|
| link-id | Required | ID of the link to attach VPC to |
| vpc-id | Required | ID of the VPC to attach |
| region | Default: `fr-par`<br />One of: `fr-par`, `nl-ams`, `pl-waw` | Region to target. If none is passed will use default region from the config |



### Create a link

Create a link (InterLink session / logical InterLink resource) in a given PoP, specifying its various configuration details. Links can either be hosted (facilitated by partners' shared physical connections) or self-hosted (for users who have purchased a dedicated physical connection).

**Usage:**

```
scw interlink link create [arg=value ...]
```


**Args:**

| Name |   | Description |
|------|---|-------------|
| project-id |  | Project ID to use. If none is passed the default project ID will be used |
| name | Required | Name of the link |
| tags.{index} |  | List of tags to apply to the link |
| pop-id | Required | PoP (location) where the link will be created |
| bandwidth-mbps | Required | Desired bandwidth for the link. Must be compatible with available link bandwidths and remaining bandwidth capacity of the connection |
| connection-id |  | If set, creates a self-hosted link using this dedicated physical connection. As the customer, specify the ID of the physical connection you already have for this link. |
| partner-id |  | If set, creates a hosted link on a partner's connection. Specify the ID of the chosen partner, who already has a shared connection with available bandwidth. |
| peer-asn |  | For self-hosted links we need the peer AS Number to establish BGP session. If not given, a default one will be assigned. |
| vlan |  | For self-hosted links only, it is possible to choose the VLAN ID. If the VLAN is not available (ie already taken or out of range), an error is returned. |
| routing-policy-v4-id |  | If set, attaches this routing policy containing IPv4 prefixes to the Link. Hence, a BGP IPv4 session will be created. |
| routing-policy-v6-id |  | If set, attaches this routing policy containing IPv6 prefixes to the Link. Hence, a BGP IPv6 session will be created. |
| region | Default: `fr-par`<br />One of: `fr-par`, `nl-ams`, `pl-waw` | Region to target. If none is passed will use default region from the config |



### Delete a link

Delete an existing link, specified by its link ID. Note that as well as deleting the link here on the Scaleway side, it is also necessary to request deletion from the partner on their side. Only when this action has been carried out on both sides will the resource be completely deleted.

**Usage:**

```
scw interlink link delete <link-id ...> [arg=value ...]
```


**Args:**

| Name |   | Description |
|------|---|-------------|
| link-id | Required | ID of the link to delete |
| region | Default: `fr-par`<br />One of: `fr-par`, `nl-ams`, `pl-waw` | Region to target. If none is passed will use default region from the config |



### Detach a routing policy

Detach a routing policy from an existing link. Without a routing policy, all routes across the link are blocked by default.

**Usage:**

```
scw interlink link detach_policy <link-id ...> [arg=value ...]
```


**Args:**

| Name |   | Description |
|------|---|-------------|
| link-id | Required | ID of the link to detach a routing policy from |
| routing-policy-id | Required | ID of the routing policy to be detached |
| region | Default: `fr-par`<br />One of: `fr-par`, `nl-ams`, `pl-waw` | Region to target. If none is passed will use default region from the config |



### Detach a VPC

Detach a VPC from an existing link.

**Usage:**

```
scw interlink link detach_vpc <link-id ...> [arg=value ...]
```


**Args:**

| Name |   | Description |
|------|---|-------------|
| link-id | Required | ID of the link to detach the VPC from |
| region | Default: `fr-par`<br />One of: `fr-par`, `nl-ams`, `pl-waw` | Region to target. If none is passed will use default region from the config |



### Disable route propagation

Prevent any prefixes from being announced in the BGP session. Traffic will not be able to flow over the InterLink until route propagation is re-enabled.

**Usage:**

```
scw interlink link disable_propagation <link-id ...> [arg=value ...]
```


**Args:**

| Name |   | Description |
|------|---|-------------|
| link-id | Required | ID of the link on which to disable route propagation |
| region | Default: `fr-par`<br />One of: `fr-par`, `nl-ams`, `pl-waw` | Region to target. If none is passed will use default region from the config |



### Enable route propagation

Enable all allowed prefixes (defined in a routing policy) to be announced in the BGP session. This allows traffic to flow between the attached VPC and the on-premises infrastructure along the announced routes. Note that by default, even when route propagation is enabled, all routes are blocked. It is essential to attach a routing policy to define the ranges of routes to announce.

**Usage:**

```
scw interlink link enable_propagation <link-id ...> [arg=value ...]
```


**Args:**

| Name |   | Description |
|------|---|-------------|
| link-id | Required | ID of the link on which to enable route propagation |
| region | Default: `fr-par`<br />One of: `fr-par`, `nl-ams`, `pl-waw` | Region to target. If none is passed will use default region from the config |



### Get a link

**Usage:**

```
scw interlink link get <link-id ...> [arg=value ...]
