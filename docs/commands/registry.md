## Image management commands

An image represents a container image. A container image is a file that includes all the requirements and instructions of a complete and executable version of an application. When running, it becomes one or multiple instances of that application.

The visibility of an image can be public - when anyone can pull it, private - when only users within your organization can pull it, or inherited from the namespace visibility - which is the default. The visibility of your image can be changed using the [update image endpoit](#path-images-update-an-image).


### Delete an image

Delete a given image. You must specify, in the endpoint, the `region` and `image_id` parameters of the image you want to delete.

**Usage:**

```
scw registry image delete <image-id ...> [arg=value ...]
```


**Args:**

| Name |   | Description |
|------|---|-------------|
| image-id | Required | UUID of the image |
| region | Default: `fr-par`<br />One of: `fr-par`, `nl-ams`, `pl-waw` | Region to target. If none is passed will use default region from the config |



### Get an image

Retrieve information about a given container image, specified by its `image_id` and region. Full details about the image, such as `name`, `namespace_id`, `status`, `visibility`, and `size` are returned in the response.

**Usage:**

```
scw registry image get <image-id ...> [arg=value ...]
```


**Args:**

| Name |   | Description |
|------|---|-------------|
| image-id | Required | UUID of the image |
| region | Default: `fr-par`<br />One of: `fr-par`, `nl-ams`, `pl-waw` | Region to target. If none is passed will use default region from the config |



### List images

List all images in a specified region. By default, the images listed are ordered by creation date in ascending order. This can be modified via the order_by field. You can also define additional parameters for your query, such as the `namespace_id` and `project_id` parameters.

**Usage:**

```
scw registry image list [arg=value ...]
```


**Args:**

| Name |   | Description |
|------|---|-------------|
| order-by | One of: `created_at_asc`, `created_at_desc`, `name_asc`, `name_desc` | Criteria to use when ordering image listings. Possible values are `created_at_asc`, `created_at_desc`, `name_asc`, `name_desc`, `region`, `status_asc` and `status_desc`. The default value is `created_at_asc`. |
| namespace-id |  | Filter by the namespace ID |
| name |  | Filter by the image name (exact match) |
| project-id |  | Filter by Project ID |
| organization-id |  | Filter by Organization ID |
| region | Default: `fr-par`<br />One of: `fr-par`, `nl-ams`, `pl-waw`, `all` | Region to target. If none is passed will use default region from the config |



### Update an image

**Args:**

| Name |   | Description |
|------|---|-------------|
| image-id | Required | ID of the image to update |
| visibility | One of: `visibility_unknown`, `inherit`, `public`, `private` | Set to `public` to allow the image to be pulled without authentication. Else, set to  `private`. Set to `inherit` to keep the same visibility configuration as the namespace |
| region | Default: `fr-par`<br />One of: `fr-par`, `nl-ams`, `pl-waw` | Region to target. If none is passed will use default region from the config |



## Install a local Docker credential helper

This command will install the Docker credential helper for your account.

It will create a new script named docker-credential-scw. 
This script will be called each time Docker needs the credentials and will return the correct credentials.
It avoid running docker login commands.

## Namespace management commands

A namespace is a collection of container images, each bearing the unique identifier of that namespace. A namespace can be either public or private, by default.

Each namespace must have a globally unique name within its region. This means no namespaces in the same region can bear the same name.

You can use namespace privacy policies to specify whether everyone has the right to pull an image from a namespace or not. When an image is in a public namespace, anyone is able to pull it. You can set your namespace to private if you want to restrict access.


### Create a namespace

Create a new Container Registry namespace. You must specify the namespace name and region in which you want it to be created. Optionally, you can specify the `project_id` and `is_public` in the request payload.

|------|---|-------------|
| name | Required<br />Default: `<generated>` | Name of the namespace |
| description |  | Description of the namespace |

| organization-id |  | Organization ID to use. If none is passed the default organization ID will be used |
| region | Default: `fr-par`<br />One of: `fr-par`, `nl-ams`, `pl-waw` | Region to target. If none is passed will use default region from the config |
