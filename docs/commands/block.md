## A Block Storage snapshot is a read-only picture of a Block volume, taken at a specific time

You can then revert your data to the previous snapshot. You can also create a new read/write Block volume from a previous snapshot.


### Create a snapshot of a volume

To create a snapshot, the volume must be in the `in_use` or the `available` status.
If your volume is in a transient state, you need to wait until the end of the current operation.

**Usage:**

```
scw block snapshot create <volume-id ...> [arg=value ...]
```


**Args:**

| Name |   | Description |
|------|---|-------------|
| volume-id | Required | UUID of the volume to snapshot |
| name | Default: `<generated>` | Name of the snapshot |
| project-id |  | Project ID to use. If none is passed the default project ID will be used |
| tags.{index} |  | List of tags assigned to the snapshot |
| zone | Default: `fr-par-1`<br />One of: `fr-par-1`, `fr-par-2`, `fr-par-3`, `nl-ams-1`, `nl-ams-2`, `nl-ams-3`, `pl-waw-1`, `pl-waw-2`, `pl-waw-3` | Zone to target. If none is passed will use default zone from the config |



### Delete a snapshot

You must specify the `snapshot_id` of the snapshot you want to delete. The snapshot must not be in use.

**Usage:**

```
scw block snapshot delete <snapshot-id ...> [arg=value ...]
```


**Args:**

| Name |   | Description |

### Export a snapshot to a Scaleway Object Storage bucket

The snapshot is exported in QCOW2 format.
The snapshot must not be in transient state.

```
scw block snapshot export-to-object-storage [arg=value ...]
```


**Args:**

| Name |   | Description |
|------|---|-------------|
| snapshot-id | Required | UUID of the snapshot |
| bucket |  | Scaleway Object Storage bucket where the object is stored |

## A Block Storage volume is a logical storage drive on a network-connected storage system. It is exposed to Instances as if it were a physical disk, and can be attached and detached like a hard drive. Several Block volumes can be attached to one Instance at a time

Block volumes can be snapshotted, mounted or unmounted.


### Create a volume

To create a new volume from scratch, you must specify `from_empty` and the `size`.
To create a volume from an existing snapshot, specify `from_snapshot` and the `snapshot_id` in the request payload instead, size is optional and can be specified if you need to extend the original size. The volume will take on the same volume class and underlying IOPS limitations as the original snapshot.

```
scw block volume create [arg=value ...]
```

| tags.{index} |  | List of tags assigned to the volume |
| zone | Default: `fr-par-1`<br />One of: `fr-par-1`, `fr-par-2`, `fr-par-3`, `nl-ams-1`, `nl-ams-2`, `nl-ams-3`, `pl-waw-1`, `pl-waw-2`, `pl-waw-3` | Zone to target. If none is passed will use default zone from the config |
