### Update WAF stage

Update the parameters of an existing WAF stage, specified by its `waf_stage_id`. Both `mode` and `paranoia_level` parameters can be updated.

**Usage:**

```
scw edge-services waf-stage update <waf-stage-id ...> [arg=value ...]
```


**Args:**

| Name |   | Description |
|------|---|-------------|
| waf-stage-id | Required | ID of the WAF stage to update |
| mode | One of: `unknown_mode`, `disable`, `log_only`, `enable` | Mode defining WAF behavior (`disable`/`log_only`/`enable`) |
| paranoia-level |  | Sensitivity level (`1`,`2`,`3`,`4`) to use when classifying requests as malicious. With a high level, requests are more likely to be classed as malicious, and false positives are expected. With a lower level, requests are more likely to be classed as benign. |
| backend-stage-id |  | ID of the backend stage to forward requests to after the WAF stage |
