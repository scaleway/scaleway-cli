## Alerting management commands

Alerting management commands.


### Disable the Alert manager

Disabling the Alert manager deletes the contact points you have created and disables managed alerts in the specified Project and region.

| region | Default: `fr-par`<br />One of: `fr-par`, `nl-ams`, `pl-waw` | Region to target. If none is passed will use default region from the config |



### Enable the Alert manager

Enabling the Alert manager allows you to enable managed alerts and create contact points in the specified Project and region, to be notified when your Scaleway resources may require your attention.

**Usage:**

```
scw cockpit alert-manager enable [arg=value ...]
```
