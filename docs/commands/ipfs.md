## A name is a hash of the public key within the IPNS (InterPlanetary Name System)

This is the PKI namespace, where the private key is used to publish (sign) a record.

This is the PKI namespace, where the private key is used to publish (sign) a record.

**Usage:**

```
scw ipfs name
```



## A pin is an abstract object that holds a Content Identifier (CID). It is defined that during the lifespan of a pin, the CID (and all sub-CIDs) must be hosted by the service

It is possible that many pins target the same CID, regardless of the user.


### Create a pin by CID

Will fetch and store the content pointed by the provided CID. The content must be available on the public IPFS network.
The content (IPFS blocks) will be host by the pinning service until pin deletion.
From that point, any other IPFS peer can fetch and host your content: Make sure to pin public or encrypted content.
Many pin requests (from different users) can target the same CID.
A pin is defined by its ID (UUID), its status (queued, pinning, pinned or failed) and target CID.

**Usage:**

```
scw ipfs pin create-by-cid [arg=value ...]
```


**Args:**

| Name |   | Description |
|------|---|-------------|
| volume-id |  |  |
| cid |  |  |
| name |  |  |
| origins.{index} |  |  |
| pin-options.required-zones.{index} |  |  |
| pin-options.replication-count |  |  |
| region | Default: `fr-par`<br />One of: `fr-par`, `nl-ams`, `pl-waw` | Region to target. If none is passed will use default region from the config |



### Create a pin by URL

Will fetch and store the content pointed by the provided URL. The content must be available on the public IPFS network.
The content (IPFS blocks) will be host by the pinning service until pin deletion.
From that point, any other IPFS peer can fetch and host your content: Make sure to pin public or encrypted content.
Many pin requests (from different users) can target the same CID.
A pin is defined by its ID (UUID), its status (queued, pinning, pinned or failed) and target CID.

**Usage:**

```
scw ipfs pin create-by-url [arg=value ...]
```


**Args:**

| Name |   | Description |
|------|---|-------------|
| volume-id |  |  |
| url |  |  |
| name |  |  |
| pin-options.required-zones.{index} |  |  |
| pin-options.replication-count |  |  |
| region | Default: `fr-par`<br />One of: `fr-par`, `nl-ams`, `pl-waw` | Region to target. If none is passed will use default region from the config |



### Create an unpin request

An unpin request means that you no longer own the content.
This content can therefore be removed and no longer provided on the IPFS network.

**Usage:**

```
scw ipfs pin delete [arg=value ...]
```


**Args:**

| Name |   | Description |
|------|---|-------------|
| volume-id |  |  |
| pin-id | Required |  |
| region | Default: `fr-par`<br />One of: `fr-par`, `nl-ams`, `pl-waw` | Region to target. If none is passed will use default region from the config |



### Get pin information

Retrieve information about the provided **pin ID**, such as status, last modification, and CID.

**Usage:**

```
scw ipfs pin get [arg=value ...]
```


**Args:**

| Name |   | Description |
|------|---|-------------|
| volume-id |  |  |
| pin-id | Required |  |
| region | Default: `fr-par`<br />One of: `fr-par`, `nl-ams`, `pl-waw` | Region to target. If none is passed will use default region from the config |



### List all pins within a volume

Retrieve information about all pins within a volume.

**Usage:**

```
scw ipfs pin list [arg=value ...]
```


**Args:**

| Name |   | Description |
|------|---|-------------|
| volume-id |  |  |
| project-id |  |  |
| order-by | One of: `created_at_asc`, `created_at_desc` |  |
| status | One of: `unknown_status`, `queued`, `pinning`, `failed`, `pinned` |  |
| organization-id |  |  |
| region | Default: `fr-par`<br />One of: `fr-par`, `nl-ams`, `pl-waw`, `all` | Region to target. If none is passed will use default region from the config |



## A volume is bucket of pins. It is similar to an Object Storage bucket. Volumes are useful to gather pins with similar lifespans

All pins must be attached to a volume. And all volumes must be attached to a Project ID.


### Create a new volume

Create a new volume from a Project ID. Volume is identified by an ID and used to host pin references.
Volume is personal (at least to your organization) even if IPFS blocks and CID are available to anyone.
Should be the first command you made because every pin must be attached to a volume.

**Usage:**

```
scw ipfs volume create [arg=value ...]
```


**Args:**

| Name |   | Description |
|------|---|-------------|
| project-id |  | Project ID to use. If none is passed the default project ID will be used |
| name |  |  |
| region | Default: `fr-par`<br />One of: `fr-par`, `nl-ams`, `pl-waw` | Region to target. If none is passed will use default region from the config |



### Delete an existing volume

Delete a volume by its ID and every pin attached to this volume. This process can take a while to conclude, depending on the size of your pinned content.

**Usage:**

```
scw ipfs volume delete [arg=value ...]
```


**Args:**

| Name |   | Description |
|------|---|-------------|
| volume-id | Required |  |
| region | Default: `fr-par`<br />One of: `fr-par`, `nl-ams`, `pl-waw` | Region to target. If none is passed will use default region from the config |



### Get information about a volume

Retrieve information about a specific volume.

**Usage:**

```
scw ipfs volume get [arg=value ...]
```


**Args:**

| Name |   | Description |
|------|---|-------------|
| volume-id | Required |  |
| region | Default: `fr-par`<br />One of: `fr-par`, `nl-ams`, `pl-waw` | Region to target. If none is passed will use default region from the config |



### List all volumes by a Project ID

Retrieve information about all volumes from a Project ID.

**Usage:**

```
scw ipfs volume list [arg=value ...]
```


**Args:**

| Name |   | Description |
|------|---|-------------|
| project-id |  | Project ID to use. If none is passed the default project ID will be used |
| order-by | One of: `created_at_asc`, `created_at_desc` |  |
| region | Default: `fr-par`<br />One of: `fr-par`, `nl-ams`, `pl-waw`, `all` | Region to target. If none is passed will use default region from the config |



### Update volume information

Update volume information (tag, name...).

**Usage:**

```
scw ipfs volume update [arg=value ...]
```


**Args:**

| Name |   | Description |
|------|---|-------------|
| volume-id | Required |  |
| name |  |  |
| tags.{index} |  |  |
| region | Default: `fr-par`<br />One of: `fr-par`, `nl-ams`, `pl-waw` | Region to target. If none is passed will use default region from the config |
