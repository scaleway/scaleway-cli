## Private network management command

A private network allows interconnecting your instances in an
isolated and private network. The network reachability is limited
to the instances that are on the same private network.  Network
Interface Controllers (NICs) are available on the instance and can
be freely managed (adding IP addresses, shutdown interface...)

Note that an instance can be a part of multiple private networks.
