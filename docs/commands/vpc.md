## Private network management command

A Private Network allows you to interconnect your Scaleway resources in an
isolated and private network. Network reachability is limited
to resources that are on the same Private Network. Note that a resource can
be part of multiple Private Networks.



### Create a Private Network

Create a new Private Network. Once created, you can attach Scaleway resources in the same Availability Zone.

**Usage:**

```
scw vpc private-network create [arg=value ...]
```


**Args:**

| Name |   | Description |
|------|---|-------------|
| name | Required<br />Default: `<generated>` | Name for the Private Network |
| project-id |  | Project ID to use. If none is passed the default project ID will be used |
| tags.{index} |  | Tags for the Private Network |
| subnets.{index} |  | Private Network subnets CIDR |
| zone | Default: `fr-par-1`<br />One of: `fr-par-1`, `fr-par-2`, `fr-par-3`, `nl-ams-1`, `nl-ams-2`, `nl-ams-3`, `pl-waw-1`, `pl-waw-2` | Zone to target. If none is passed will use default zone from the config |



### Delete a Private Network

Delete an existing Private Network. Note that you must first detach all resources from the network, in order to delete it.

**Usage:**

```
scw vpc private-network delete <private-network-id ...> [arg=value ...]
```


**Args:**

| Name |   | Description |
|------|---|-------------|
| private-network-id | Required | Private Network ID |
| zone | Default: `fr-par-1`<br />One of: `fr-par-1`, `fr-par-2`, `fr-par-3`, `nl-ams-1`, `nl-ams-2`, `nl-ams-3`, `pl-waw-1`, `pl-waw-2` | Zone to target. If none is passed will use default zone from the config |



### Get a Private Network

Retrieve information about an existing Private Network, specified by its Private Network ID. Its full details are returned in the response object.

**Usage:**

```
scw vpc private-network get <private-network-id ...> [arg=value ...]
```


**Args:**

| Name |   | Description |
|------|---|-------------|
| private-network-id | Required | Private Network ID |
| zone | Default: `fr-par-1`<br />One of: `fr-par-1`, `fr-par-2`, `fr-par-3`, `nl-ams-1`, `nl-ams-2`, `nl-ams-3`, `pl-waw-1`, `pl-waw-2` | Zone to target. If none is passed will use default zone from the config |



### List Private Networks

List existing Private Networks in a specified Availability Zone. By default, the Private Networks returned in the list are ordered by creation date in ascending order, though this can be modified via the order_by field.

**Usage:**

```
scw vpc private-network list [arg=value ...]
```


**Args:**

| Name |   | Description |
|------|---|-------------|
| order-by | One of: `created_at_asc`, `created_at_desc`, `name_asc`, `name_desc` | Sort order of the returned Private Networks |
| name |  | Name to filter for. Only Private Networks with names containing this string will be returned |
| tags.{index} |  | Tags to filter for. Only Private Networks with one or more matching tags will be returned |
| project-id |  | Project ID to filter for. Only Private Networks belonging to this Project will be returned |
| private-network-ids.{index} |  | Private Network IDs to filter for. Only Private Networks with one of these IDs will be returned |
| include-regional |  | Defines whether to include regional Private Networks in the response |
| organization-id |  | Organization ID to filter for. Only Private Networks belonging to this Organization will be returned |
| zone | Default: `fr-par-1`<br />One of: `fr-par-1`, `fr-par-2`, `fr-par-3`, `nl-ams-1`, `nl-ams-2`, `nl-ams-3`, `pl-waw-1`, `pl-waw-2`, `all` | Zone to target. If none is passed will use default zone from the config |



### Update Private Network

Update parameters (such as name or tags) of an existing Private Network, specified by its Private Network ID.

**Usage:**

|------|---|-------------|
| private-network-id | Required | Private Network ID |
| name |  | Name of the private network |
| tags.{index} |  | Tags for the Private Network |
| ~~subnets.{index}~~ | Deprecated | Private Network subnets CIDR (deprecated) |
| zone | Default: `fr-par-1`<br />One of: `fr-par-1`, `fr-par-2`, `fr-par-3`, `nl-ams-1`, `nl-ams-2`, `nl-ams-3`, `pl-waw-1`, `pl-waw-2` | Zone to target. If none is passed will use default zone from the config |
