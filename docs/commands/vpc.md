## Private network management command

A Private Network allows you to interconnect your Scaleway resources
in an isolated and private network. Network reachability is limited
to resources that are on the same Private Network. Note that a
resource can be a part of multiple private networks.


### Create a Private Network

Create a new Private Network. Once created, you can attach Scaleway resources which are in the same region.

**Usage:**

```
scw vpc private-network create [arg=value ...]
```


**Args:**

| Name |   | Description |
|------|---|-------------|
| name | Required<br />Default: `<generated>` | Name for the Private Network |
| project-id |  | Project ID to use. If none is passed the default project ID will be used |
| tags.{index} |  | Tags for the Private Network |
| subnets.{index} |  | Private Network subnets CIDR |
| vpc-id |  | VPC in which to create the Private Network |
| default-route-propagation-enabled |  | Defines whether default v4 and v6 routes are propagated for this Private Network |
| region | Default: `fr-par`<br />One of: `fr-par`, `nl-ams`, `pl-waw` | Region to target. If none is passed will use default region from the config |



### Delete a Private Network

Delete an existing Private Network. Note that you must first detach all resources from the network, in order to delete it.

```
scw vpc private-network delete <private-network-id ...> [arg=value ...]
