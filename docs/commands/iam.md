## API keys management commands

API keys management commands.


### Create an API key

Create an API key. You must specify the `application_id` or the `user_id` and the description. You can also specify the `default_project_id`, which is the Project ID of your preferred Project, to use with Object Storage. The `access_key` and `secret_key` values are returned in the response. Note that the secret key is only shown once. Make sure that you copy and store both keys somewhere safe.

**Usage:**

```
scw iam api-key create [arg=value ...]
```


**Args:**

| Name |   | Description |
|------|---|-------------|
| application-id |  | ID of the application |
| user-id |  | ID of the user |
