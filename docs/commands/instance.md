## Image management commands

Images are backups of your instances.
You can reuse that image to restore your data or create a series of instances with a predefined configuration.

An image is a complete backup of your server including all volumes.

## Placement group management commands

Placement groups allow the user to express a preference regarding
the physical position of a group of instances. It'll let the user
choose to either group instances on the same physical hardware for
best network throughput and low latency or to spread instances on
far away hardware to reduce the risk of physical failure.

The operating mode is selected by a `policy_type`. Two policy
types are available:
  - `low_latency` will group instances on the same hypervisors
  - `max_availability` will spread instances on far away hypervisors

The `policy_type` is set by default to `max_availability`.

For each policy types, one of the two `policy_mode` may be selected:
  - `optional` will start your instances even if the constraint is not respected
  - `enforced` guarantee that if the instance starts, the constraint is respected

The `policy_mode` is set by default to `optional`.

## Security group management commands

A security group is a set of firewall rules on a set of instances.
Security groups enable to create rules that either drop or allow incoming traffic from certain ports of your instances.

Security Groups are stateful by default which means return traffic is automatically allowed, regardless of any rules.
As a contrary, you have to switch in a stateless mode to define explicitly allowed.

## Server management commands

Server types are denomination of the different instances we provide.
Scaleway offers **Virtual Cloud** and **dedicated GPU** instances.

**Virtual Cloud Instances**

Virtual cloud instances are offering the best performance/price ratio for most workloads.
Different instance ranges are proposed:

* The **Development** instances range provides stable and consistent performance for
  development and testing needs. Spin up a development or test environment within seconds.
  Refer to the [Development Instance offer details](https://www.scaleway.com/en/virtual-instances/play2/)
  for more information.

* The **General Purpose** instances range is the solution for production workloads. Powerful
  AMD EPYC CPUs back those instances and offer up to 48 Cores, 256GB of RAM and storage
  options up to 600GB of replicated local NVMe SSD storage and/or up to 10TB of Block Storage.
  Refer to the [General Purpose offer details](https://www.scaleway.com/en/virtual-instances/pro2/) for more information.

* The **Enterprise** instances range is the solution for most demanding workloads and
  mission-critical applications. Powerful AMD EPYC CPUs back those instances and
  offer up to 96 Cores, 384GB of RAM and up to 10TB of Block Storage. Refer to the
  [Enterprise offer details](https://www.scaleway.com/en/virtual-instances/enterprise/) for more information.

**Dedicated GPU Instances**

Scaleway GPU Instances are virtual compute instances equipped with dedicated high-end
Nvidia graphical processing unit (GPUs). They are ideal for data processing, artificial
intelligence, rendering and video encoding. The GPU is dedicated to each instance and
directly exposed through PCI-e. For more information, refer to the
[GPU Instances Developper Documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/compute/gpu/quickstart/).

## Server type management commands

Server types will answer with all instance types available in a given zone.
Each of these types will contains all the features of the instance (CPU, RAM, Storage) with their associated pricing.



### List server types

```
scw instance server-type list [arg=value ...]
```

## Snapshot management commands

Snapshots contain the data of a specific volume at a particular point in time.
The data can include the instance's operating system,
configuration information or files stored on the volume.

A snapshot can be done from a specific volume (for example you
have a server with a volume containing the OS and another one
containing the application data, and you want to use different
snapshot strategies on both volumes).

A snapshot's volume type can be either its original volume's type
(`l_ssd` or `b_ssd`) or `unified`. Similarly, volumes can be created as well from snapshots
of their own type or `unified`. Therefore, to migrate data from a `l_ssd` volume
to a `b_ssd` volume, one can create a `unified` snapshot from the original volume
and a new `b_ssd` volume from this snapshot. The newly created volume will hold a copy
of the data of the original volume.

## User data management commands

User data is a key value store API you can use to provide data from and to your server without authentication.

As an example of use, Scaleway images contain the script scw-generate-ssh-keys which generates SSH server’s host keys then stores their fingerprints as user data under the key “ssh-host-fingerprints”.
This way, we ensure they are really connecting to their Scaleway instance and they are not victim of a man-in-the-middle attack.

There are two endpoints to access user data:
 - **From a running instance**, by using the metadata API at http://169.254.42.42/user_data.
   To enhance security, we only allow user data viewing and editing as root.
   To know if the query is issued by the root user, we only accept queries made from a local port below 1024 (by default, non-root users can’t bind ports below 1024).
   To specify the local port with cURL, use `curl --local-port 1-1024 http://169.254.42.42/user_data`
 - **From the instance API** at using methods described bellow.

## Volume management commands

A volume is where you store your data inside your instance. It
appears as a block device on Linux that you can use to create
a filesystem and mount it.

We have two different types of volume (`volume_type`):
  - `l_ssd` is a local block storage: your data is downloaded on
    the hypervisor and you need to power off your instance to attach
    or detach a volume.
  - `b_ssd` is a remote block storage: your data is stored on a
    centralised cluster. You can plug and unplug a volume while
    your instance is running. As of today, `b_ssd` is only available
    for `DEV1`, `GP1` and `RENDER` offers.

note: The `unified` volume type is not available for volumes. This
type can only be used on snapshots.

Minimum and maximum volume sizes for each volume types can be queried
from the zone `/products/volumes` API endpoint. _I.e_ for:
  - `fr-par-1`  use https://api.scaleway.com/instance/v1/zones/fr-par-1/products/volumes
  - `nl-ams-1`  use https://api.scaleway.com/instance/v1/zones/nl-ams-1/products/volumes

Each types of volumes is also subject to a global quota for the sum of all the
volumes. This quota depends of the level of support and may be
changed on demand.

Be wary that when terminating an instance, if you want to keep
your block storage volume, **you must** detach it beforehand you
issue the `terminate` call.

When using multiple block devices, it's advised to mount them by
using their UUID instead of their device name. A device name is
subject to change depending on the volumes order. Block devices
UUIDs can be found in `/dev/disk/by-id/`.
