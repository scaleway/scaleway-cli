### Wait for a node to reach a stable state

Wait for a node to reach a stable state. This is similar to using --wait flag on other action commands, but without requiring a new action on the node.

**Usage:**

```
scw k8s node wait <node-id ...> [arg=value ...]
```


**Args:**

| Name |   | Description |
|------|---|-------------|
| node-id | Required | ID of the node. |
| region | Default: `fr-par` | Region to target. If none is passed will use default region from the config |


**Examples:**


Wait for a node to reach a stable state
```
scw k8s node wait 11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
```




## Kapsule pool management commands

A pool is a set of identical Nodes. A pool has a name, a size (its current number of nodes), nodes number limits (min, max) and a Scaleway instance type.
Changing those limits increases/decreases the size of a pool. Thus, when autoscaling is enabled, the pool will grow or shrink inside those limits, depending on its load.
A "default pool" is automatically created with every cluster.
