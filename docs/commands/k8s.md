Replace a specific node. The node will be set cordoned, meaning that scheduling will be disabled. Then the existing pods on the node will be drained and reschedule onto another schedulable node. Then the node will be deleted, and a new one will be created after the deletion. Note that when there is not enough space to reschedule all the pods (in a one node cluster for instance), you may experience some disruption of your applications.

## Kapsule pool management commands

A pool is a set of identical nodes. A pool has a name, a size (its current number of nodes), node number limits (min, max), and a Scaleway Instance type. Changing those limits increases/decreases the size of a pool. Thus, the pool will grow or shrink inside those limits when autoscaling is enabled, depending on its load. A "default pool" is automatically created with every cluster.
