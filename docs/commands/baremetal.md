## Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) management commands

Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) allows you to remotely access the low-level parameters of your dedicated server.
For instance, your KVM-IP management console could be accessed with it.
You need first to create an option Remote Access. You will find the ID and the price with a call to listOffers (https://developers.scaleway.com/en/products/baremetal/api/#get-78db92). Then you can add the option https://developers.scaleway.com/en/products/baremetal/api/#post-b14abd. Do not forget to delete the Option.
Then you need to create Remote Access https://developers.scaleway.com/en/products/baremetal/api/#post-1af723.
And finally Get Remote Access to get the login/password https://developers.scaleway.com/en/products/baremetal/api/#get-cefc0f.
