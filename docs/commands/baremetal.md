## Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) management commands

A Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) allows you to remotely access the low-level parameters of your dedicated server.
For instance, your KVM-IP management console could be accessed with it.
You need first to create an Remote Access option. You will find the ID and the price with a call to listOffers (https://developers.scaleway.com/en/products/baremetal/api/#get-78db92). Then you can add the option https://developers.scaleway.com/en/products/baremetal/api/#post-b14abd. Do not forget to delete the Option.
Then you need to create Remote Access https://developers.scaleway.com/en/products/baremetal/api/#post-1af723.
And finally Get Remote Access to get the login/password https://developers.scaleway.com/en/products/baremetal/api/#get-cefc0f.


### Get BMC access

Get the BMC (Baseboard Management Controller) access associated with the ID, including the URL and login information needed to connect.

**Usage:**

```
scw baremetal bmc get [arg=value ...]
```


**Args:**

| Name |   | Description |
|------|---|-------------|

| zone | Default: `fr-par-1`<br />One of: `fr-par-1`, `fr-par-2`, `nl-ams-1`, `nl-ams-2`, `pl-waw-2`, `pl-waw-3` | Zone to target. If none is passed will use default zone from the config |



### Start BMC access

Start BMC (Baseboard Management Controller) access associated with the ID.
The BMC (Baseboard Management Controller) access is available one hour after the installation of the server.
You need first to create an option Remote Access. You will find the ID and the price with a call to listOffers (https://developers.scaleway.com/en/products/baremetal/api/#get-78db92). Then add the option https://developers.scaleway.com/en/products/baremetal/api/#post-b14abd.
After adding the BMC option, you need to Get Remote Access to get the login/password https://developers.scaleway.com/en/products/baremetal/api/#get-cefc0f. Do not forget to delete the Option after use.
